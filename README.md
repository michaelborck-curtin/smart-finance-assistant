## ðŸ“– Project Overview
In this project, you will design and implement a **Smart Finance Assistant** using:
- Python (Google Colab)
- [hands-on-ai](https://pypi.org/project/hands-on-ai/) (chat, RAG, agent tools)
- [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/) (to create a simple app interface)

Your Assistant should include:
- **Chat**: a finance-oriented personality bot
- **RAG**: retrieval from CSV or other documents
- **Agent Tool**: one custom tool (e.g., budget calculator, currency converter)
- **Gradio UI**: a simple interface tying everything together
- **Tests**: a Testing Section in your notebook

---

The technical requirements: Jupyter Notebook/Python/Hands on AI/Colab/Pandas 
## ðŸ“‚ Suggested Repo Layout
The key features are
CSV cleaning with business error messages
To check on spending analysis along with the category 
An AI generated tool that helps with savings
A functional chatbot that converses
Tools to check for saving and clearing currencies.
A testing module that is automated

```
Example Output: 20 Transactions
Top Category: Groceries (420)
Overspending Category Entertainment
Suggestion: Reduce Dining

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
1. Open the `starter_notebook.ipynb` in Google Colab.
2. Follow the **six-step methodology**:
   1. Understand the problem
   2. Identify inputs and outputs
   3. Work the problem by hand
   4. Write pseudocode
   5. Convert to Python
   6. Test with a variety of data
3. Add at least one **meaningful GitHub commit per week** (Weeks 8â€“12).
4. Document AI use in your **Developerâ€™s Diary** (`/ai-conversations/` folder or a markdown file).

---

## âœ… Submission Requirements
- Colab Notebook with full project implementation
- GitHub repository with:
  - Notebook, README, and Developerâ€™s Diary
  - Weekly AI Evidence Packages (Weeks 8â€“12)
  - Meaningful commit history
- Developerâ€™s Diary entries that include:
  - **Artifact**: screenshot or snippet of AI use
  - **Context**: your goal
  - **Reflection**: what worked, what didnâ€™t, what you learned

---

## ðŸ“Š Assessment Criteria (Summary)
- **Functionality** â€“ chatbot, RAG, tool, and UI integrated (30%)
- **Testing & Debugging** â€“ clear tests, meaningful edge cases (20%)
- **AI Collaboration & Progress** â€“ AI evidence + weekly commits (20%)
- **Business Relevance** â€“ meaningful finance problem (15%)
- **Clarity & Reflection** â€“ repo organisation, README, diary (15%)

For the full rubric, see `assignment.pdf`.

## ðŸ’¡ Tips
- Keep your commits small and descriptive.
- Use AI as a coding partner, not a crutch.
- Remember: **undocumented AI use = misconduct**.

Good luck, and have fun building your Finance Assistant! ðŸŽ‰
