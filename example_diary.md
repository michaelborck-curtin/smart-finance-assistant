# üìì Developer's Diary ‚Äì AI Collaboration Guide

This file shows sample entries for your **Developer's Diary**. You must document your AI collaboration throughout the project development. Each entry should have:
- **Artifact**: a screenshot, GIF, or snippet of your AI interaction
- **Context**: one-sentence description of your goal
- **Reflection**: analysis of what happened, what you learned, and how you improved the solution

**Key Principle**: You're directing AI like a junior developer - always review, critique, and improve their suggestions.

## Foundation Skills Examples

### Entry 1 ‚Äì Effective AI Prompting for Business Data

WEEK 8
<img width="1451" height="613" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-22 180347" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2495acdd-cd6d-45b0-90be-b150c422d21d" />

AI prompt: To help me brainstorm specific finance problems with a CSV tool and to invest on people's budgeting.

**Reflection:** I started my project goal based off a Financial Assistant to analyse csv file and to find out where the overspending is based off the money to find the problems and tracking category.

Outcome: To have a project created with the help of smart financial assistant that takes transaction to budgeting.<img width="1398" height="685" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-22 174745" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9da5e1c5-7f4a-4442-92e1-da6d7c01b4c8" />

### Entry 2 ‚Äì Critiquing and Improving AI Code
WEEK 9
**Artifact:** Before/after screenshots of AI-generated spending analysis code.

**Context:** AI gave me complex code that was hard to understand for my transaction analysis.

**AI's First Response:**<img width="1398" height="685" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-22 174745" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34765b9e-28c2-424d-88a7-dfc354aa5b7b" />

```python
df.groupby('Category')['Amount'].agg({'sum','mean','count'}).round(2)
```

**My Critique:** "The code is quite messy and the code does not provide enough details"

**AI's Improved Response:**
```python
# Clean amount data by removing dollar signs
df['Amount_Clean'] = pd.to_numeric(df['Amount'].str.replace('$', ''), errors='coerce')

# Calculate spending metrics by category
spending_summary = df.groupby('Category')['Amount_Clean'].agg({
    'Total_Spent': 'sum',
    'Average_Amount': 'mean', 
    'Transaction_Count': 'count'
}).round(2)
```

**Reflection:** I made the data flow by assistant that identifies the CSV file which includes date category along with defined outputs that may include summaries along with spending trends.

Outcome: Technical and Business outputs are finalized

### Entry 3 ‚Äì Business Context in AI Interactions WEEK 10
**Artifact:** Screenshot of Gemini generating financial insights from data.

**Context:** I wanted AI to help generate business recommendations from spending analysis.

<img width="1382" height="350" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-22 180236" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24fd9cbb-d183-4126-bca6-c19e688ce69d" />
<img width="1157" height="251" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-22 180141" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c92543df-5a2a-45c6-9ed9-52a6e9b4f002" />


**Reflection:** 
--- When writing the code I had to consider the examples of spending, refunds along with the tests to confirm that refunds can be negative

Outcome: A sample data with reference and logic for spending analysis.

### Entry 4 ‚Äì Data Quality and Edge Cases WEEK 11
**Artifact:** Screenshot of debugging session with Claude about handling messy CSV data.

**Context:** My CSV had negative amounts (refunds) and missing values that broke my calculations.
<img width="1372" height="659" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-22 180354" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a80870de-3567-434f-aaa6-401005ae0559" />


<img width="1210" height="513" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-22 180654" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e0a088d-42a3-46d5-b243-581b8332182c" />
<img width="1410" height="613" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-22 180455" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d510cb4-ec67-4d4b-a8c4-c42d28504309" />

**My Problem:** "The pseudocode results are not applying so i had to ask AI to fix up things"

**AI Solution:** Helped me add data validation:
```python
# Handle refunds and missing data appropriately
df_clean = df.dropna(subset=['Amount_Clean'])
positive_spending = df_clean[df_clean['Amount_Clean'] > 0]
refunds = df_clean[df_clean['Amount_Clean'] < 0]
```

**Reflection:** The AI has helped me convert the pseudocode that functions and also have the CSV data working along with removing symbols and converts the amount and tells if the business has error. Also developed a  function to have avoiding overspendings and financial recommendation and provide intel with the spending category


outcome: The csv is valid and working. and also the AI chatbot is working with AI driven advice

## Advanced Integration Examples

### Entry 5 ‚Äì Combining Multiple AI Tools WEEK 12
**Artifact:** Screenshot showing integration of hands-on-ai chat with pandas analysis.
<img width="1397" height="666" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-22 183030" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09bf1b78-4fa4-49c8-a717-c7e77885c20c" />


<img width="1272" height="657" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-22 182403" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e420ebca-94ee-4928-9218-33ba8693d194" />


**Context:** To have a test ready and an advisor for the chatbot

**My Approach:** The AI helped me get the CSV file and the Chatbot building that responds to the queries

**Key Learning:** AI taught me both the structure of code and the logic behind the code but the business plan was purely determined
**Reflection:** Integrating multiple technologies requires understanding how each piece serves the business purpose. AI can generate technical integration code, but I need to guide it toward business value.

### Entry 6 ‚Äì Professional Error Handling
**Artifact:** Code snippet showing error handling for file uploads.

**Context:** I needed my Gradio interface to handle bad CSV files gracefully.

**AI Suggestion:** Generated try/catch blocks with business-appropriate error messages:
```python
try:
    df = pd.read_csv(file.name)
    # Analysis code...
except FileNotFoundError:
    return "Please upload a valid CSV file."
except pd.errors.EmptyDataError:
    return "The uploaded file appears to be empty. Please check your data."
```

**Reflection:** AI helped me think about user experience, not just technical functionality. Good error messages help users understand what went wrong and how to fix it. This is crucial for business applications.

## AI Collaboration Best Practices I've Learned

### üéØ Effective Prompting Strategies
1. **Always provide business context**: "I'm building a finance assistant for..."
2. **Specify data structure**: "My CSV has columns X, Y, Z with these data types..."  
3. **Request professional formatting**: "Format output for business presentation"
4. **Ask for comments**: "Include clear comments explaining the business logic"

### ü§î Critique Questions I Always Ask
- "Does this handle edge cases like negative amounts or missing data?"
- "Are the variable names clear for a business context?"
- "How would I explain this code to a non-technical manager?"
- "What assumptions is this code making about my data?"

### üîÑ Iterative Improvement Process
1. **Get basic working code** from AI
2. **Test with real data** and find issues  
3. **Ask AI to fix specific problems** with context
4. **Simplify complex solutions** for maintainability
5. **Add business-appropriate formatting** and error handling

### üìä Business Value Focus
- Always connect code back to business decisions
- Format outputs for non-technical users
- Include actionable insights, not just data summaries
- Consider the end user's needs and context
